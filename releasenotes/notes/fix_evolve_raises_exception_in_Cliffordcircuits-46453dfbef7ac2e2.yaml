    Fixed an issue with the a bug in the BasePauli/Pauli classes where the phase vector is sometimes set as 
    dtype uint8 instead of int64 leading to errors when calling the evolve function for circuits containing 
    gates that modify the pauli phase vector.
    The dtype of the phase vector should always be the same, so that evolution and other methods that attempt
    to inplace modify the vector don't cause exceptions for mismatched dtypes.
    Fixed #8438 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-terra/issues/8438>
